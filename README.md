### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Kshitij Anand, a fourth year undergraduate at IIT Kharagpur. I am an undergraduate researcher and my current focus lies at an intersection of insect flight aerodynamics and robotic control. I mostly share code solutions to courses I do openly on Github. Most of my project codes are private as of now due to IP obligations.

For all formal communications: kshitijanand.iitkgp@gmail.com

You can informally text me on Twitter [@airobofan](https://twitter.com/airobofan) 

I am open to collaborating on research projects in robotics and aerodynamics, and prefer them more if they are experimental.
